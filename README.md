# Bulls and Cows

A small console based game that requires the user to guess a particular word by the hints provided in the form of Bulls and Cows accumulated.

## Tech-Stack

The entire code base uses pure C++11. 
No other technologies apart from project maintainance tools were used

## Remarks

I made this game while taking an Unreal Engine development course online.

A lot of code may look redundant and overly simple as I was still learning at that time. I will be making changes as I see fit.

## Development

Project maintained on Microsoft Visual Studio 2015
